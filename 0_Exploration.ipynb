Force Account means the direct performance of facility construction by a grantee's own permanent workforce (consisting of trades and crafts personnel), equipment, materials, and supplies furnished by the grantee and used under the direct control of the grantee. t. Maintenance and Operations means programmatic activities and those activities required to assure the dependable and economical function of a completed facility as follows: 1.Maintenance—preservation of the functional integri- ty and efficiency of the facility and its fixed equipment, including preventive maintenance, corrective maintenance, testing, and replacement of defective components thereof. 2.Operations—activities or processes associated with the programs to be housed in a completed facility and those processes which are necessary to run the facility. These include, but are not limited to, research, extension, or teaching programs; acquisition of programmatic machinery or equipment; post-occupancy installation of utilities or wiring; utility usage, repair, or upgrade; services (e.g., trash, snow, hazardous waste removal); administration; recordkeeping; laboratory or process control; and safety or emergency operations. u. Movable Equipment means an article of tangible personal property which is not affixed to the real estate and can be shifted from place to place without requiring a change in utilities or structural characteristics of the space. Examples include, but are not limited to, office equipment, furniture, and scientific instrumentation. v. Onset of Construction means, in general, initiation of physical on-site construction activities which are of a permanent or irreversible nature. Such activities include, but are not limited to, site clearing and removal, excavation, installation of building supports and foundations, and laying of underground piping. w. Prior Approval means written documentation from the Authorized Departmental Officer evidencing consent prior to the grantee's undertaking specific activities or incurring specific project cost(s) under this grant award. x. Program, and its derivatives, is a contextual term that means a coherent assembly of plans, activities, and supporting resources within an administrative or technical framework whose purpose is to implement the mission or goals of the grantee or CSREES. As it relates to the grantee, this term refers to the research, extension, or teaching activities, or administrative functions related to such activities, to be housed in a completed facility, the construction of which is being assisted with CSREES funds. As it relates to CSREES, this term refers to the 1890 Facilities Program. y. Project means an organized assembly of approved activities or tasks that have been determined by CSREES to lie within the scope of, or have been identified for performance by the recipient or a third party under, this grant. z. Project Costs means total costs encompassing both the allowable Federal and non-Federal costs incurred by the grantee to carry out approved activities under this grant award. aa. Project Director means the grantee's representative designated in this grant award who is responsible for oversight, management, and direction of day-to-day project activities. bb. Project Period means the total time for which this grant award is approved for support, including any pre-award period and time extensions. cc. Real Property means land, land improvements, structures, and things attached to them (e.g., fixed equipment as defined in Article 3) so as to become a part of them. Movable machinery and other kinds of movable equipment are not real property. If a question comes up about whether certain property should be classified as real property, the laws of the state in which the property is located govern. Land improvements include roads; gas, water, and utility lines; sewers; and the like which are situated on the land. As used herein, real property does not include mineral rights, timber rights, agricultural crops, and the like. dd. Value Engineering means an organized effort directed by a person trained in value engineering techniques to analyze the functions of a facility and its fixed equipment for the purpose of achieving their respective essential functions at the lowest life cycle cost consistent with required performance, reliability, quality, and safety. 4. ASSURANCE AND CERTIFICATIONS Assurance. As a condition of this grant award, the grantee assures that it is in compliance and will comply in the course of grant performance with all applicable laws, regulations, Executive Orders, and other generally applicable requirements, including those set out in 7 CFR 3015.205(b), which hereby are incorporated in this grant award by reference, and such other provisions as are specified herein. Certifications. In accepting this grant award, the grantee specifically certifies that: a. It will assist CSREES in complying with §106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (16 U.S.C. 470), Executive Order 11593, and the Historic and Archeological Data Preservation Act of 1974 (16 U.S.C. 469a —469c), as implemented in 7 CFR Part 3100 by: 1.Consulting with the State Historic Preservation Officer to identify properties listed in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places that are subject to adverse effects by the construction activity (see 36 CFR 800.8); 2.Notifying the Authorized Departmental Officer of the existence of any such properties; and 3.Avoiding or mitigating, to the extent possible, adverse effects upon such properties. b. It will comply with all requirements of §114 of the\""
